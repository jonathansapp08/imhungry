The age old question of what do you want to eat has plagued us for years with no answer in sight. Looking to resolve this issue entirely, I decided to create an app to answer for me.

Whattoeat.io asks users for an address and, with the help of the Google Maps API, returns a restaurant within 5 miles of the address.
